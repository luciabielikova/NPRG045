Samce jsou větší než samice a mají typickou hřívu. Mláďata mají skvrny a barva dospělých je plavá hnědá.","Rezervace Gírský les v západní Indii","Živá kořist","Obratlovci do velikosti buvola","Délka těla 1,4-2,5 m; délka ocasu 90-105 cm; výška v kohoutku 1-1,2 m; hmotnost 120-250 kg","Samice je březí 100-119 dní, rodí 1-6 mláďat.","Lvi jsou jedinými kočkovitými šelmami, které žijí ve skupinách. U lvů afrických vedou rodinnou skupinu jeden nebo dva nejsilnější samci, kteří se však lovu neúčastní. Ten je záležitostí lvic, z nichž některé číhají v záloze a jiné jim kořist nadhánějí. Z úlovku se nejprve nasytí vedoucí samci. Samotářsky žijí většinou jen staří samci nebo naopak mladí lvi, kteří nedokážou skupinu samic účinně obránit před jinými samci. Naproti tomu u lvů indických žijí samci mimo smečku, tedy samotářsky, a sami aktivně loví.","Lvi kdysi obývali nejen Afriku, ale také Asii a jižní Evropu. Z asijské populace zbyl nepatrný počet lvů v rezervaci Gírský les v Indii. Právě na kriticky ohrožené lvy indické se v posledních letech soustředily snahy zoologických zahrad o jejich záchranu. V rámci Evropského záchovného programu (EEP) se do tohoto úsilí zapojila i pražská zoo.","Lvi, i když ti afričtí, však byli v pražské zoo chováni už dávno předtím – vlastně ještě dříve, než byla otevřena pro veřejnost. Prvním z nich se stala malá lvice Šárka, dar ředitele cirkusu Rebernigg, která žila od března 1930 ve vile zakladatele zoo prof. Jiřího Jandy.", "[[14.4093285,50.1182447],[14.4093117,50.1182081]]"

Males are not only larger than females but also have a typical mane. Cubs are spotted and only turn the adult tan color at three years old. A distinctive feature is the tail tip, which is covered with long hairs.","Gir Forest Reserve in western India","Live prey","Vertebrates up to the size of a buffalo","Body length 1.4-2.5 m; tail length 90-105 cm; shoulder height 1-1.2 m; weight 120-250 kg","Females are pregnant for 100-119 days, giving birth to 1-6 cubs.","Lions are the only big cats that live in groups. African lions are led by one or two dominant males who do not participate in hunting. The hunt is mainly done by females, some of whom wait in ambush while others drive the prey towards them. Males feed first on the kill. Most lions live alone or in small groups, often only young or old males. Indian lions, in contrast, are solitary hunters and only join females for mating or when large prey is taken down.","Lions once inhabited not only Africa but also Asia and Southern Europe. A small population of Indian lions remains in the Gir Forest Reserve in India. In recent years, conservation efforts have focused on these critically endangered lions, with several zoos, including Prague Zoo, contributing to their preservation. Prague Zoo has housed Indian lions since 2004.","Lions, including African ones, have been housed in Prague Zoo since before it was open to the public. The first lion, a small female named Šárka, was a gift from the director of the Rebernigg circus and lived in the villa of the zoo's founder, Prof. Jiří Janda, from March 1930.", "[[14.4093285,50.1182447],[14.4093117,50.1182081]]"

Typical are the long tufts of dark hairs at the tips of the auricles and the black lines on the face.","Africa except for the Sahara and the Congo Basin, across the Arabian Peninsula to western Asia","Live prey","Smaller vertebrates including birds, porcupines or small antelopes","Body length 60–91.5 cm, tail length 23–31 cm, shoulder height 38–50 cm, weight 13–19 kg","The female is pregnant for 69–78 days, giving birth to 2–4 young.","Although the caracal may resemble a lynx by the tufts of hair on its auricles, it is actually closely related to servals. The caracal's fur perfectly camouflages it in the open dry landscape. It is well adapted to life in places where water is scarce and manages the fluids contained in food very efficiently. It is extremely agile and strong, moves deftly between steep boulders and jumps and climbs well. Therefore, it can also hunt down elusive hyraxes. Its frequent prey is also birds, which it often catches with a single jump directly in flight. It even overcomes animals that are quite large in relation to its body, such as storks. Adult caracals are solitary and males defend their territory, but the young often stay together until they mature.","","Caracals have been kept in Prague Zoo in three periods. First from 1961 to 1971, then from 1982−1989 and then from 2004 to the present. However, most of the animals from the 1960s belonged to the so-called transit species. They traveled to various European zoos from the Moscow Zoocenter via Prague. Only a pair from Brno Zoo stayed with us for five years (1966−1971). Breeding in human care is not very common in these graceful predators. In Prague Zoo, two young have been successfully bred so far – in 2009 and 2010. Their parents are the female Karkulka (born 2006 in Animal Park) and the male Karkuš (born 2008 in Tierpark Berlin).", "[[14.4093285,50.1182447],[14.4093117,50.1182081]]"
