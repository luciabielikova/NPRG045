  "attractions": "Gibbons appear slim and fragile but possess extraordinary arm strength. They don’t need a tail, as they move between branches using a unique method called brachiation: hanging by their fingers, they swing with effortless grace to the next branch, covering up to 10 meters in a single leap. When a female gives birth, the infant clings tightly to her fur, safely pressed against her belly as she swings through the forest. Gibbons can also walk bipedally over short distances, standing on bent legs and balancing with their long arms like tightrope walkers. They live in small groups consisting of a parental pair and offspring of various ages. They are gentle animals, with conflicts among them being rare. Each family group inhabits its own territory, marked primarily by vocalizations. Each gibbon has a distinctive voice, serving both to claim territory and maintain family contact. Like nearly all primates, gibbons are diurnal, spending nights curled up in tree canopies and singing at dawn.",
