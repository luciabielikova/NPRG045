  "name": "Scimitar-horned Oryx",
  "description": "Both males and females have horns over a meter long, curved into an arc. Like most desert and semi-desert antelopes, adults are light-colored with a rusty neck and shoulders and dark markings on the forehead and nose. Calves are born beige.",
  "spread_note": "Originally northern Africa, now only in reserves in Tunisia, Morocco, and Senegal",
  "food": "Plant parts",
  "food_note": "Grass, leaves",
  "image_alt": "Photo: Prague Zoo Archive",
  "proportions": "Body length 1.9–2.2 m; tail length 45–80 cm; shoulder height 1.1–1.2 m; weight 125–205 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation 240–256 days; 1 young",
  "attractions": "They form fairly large herds, usually led by a dominant male. These antelopes are of the 'hider' type, meaning calves remain motionless in a hide for the first days after birth, with the mother visiting only to nurse. The coloration of young oryxes blends perfectly with the parched soil and dry grasses of their homeland. Scimitar-horned oryxes are superbly adapted to desert life, enduring temperatures other mammals couldn’t survive. Their body temperature can rise to 46°C during the day and drop by ten degrees at night. Blood flowing to the brain passes through a network of capillaries in the nostrils, cooling it. They also manage water efficiently, lasting days without drinking.",
  "projects_note": "Once widespread across northern Africa’s deserts and semi-deserts, hunting and habitat changes left only a small population in Chad and Niger by the late 20th century. Since the late 1980s, they’ve not been observed in the wild despite repeated efforts, leading the IUCN to declare them extinct in the wild in 2000. Fortunately, they thrive in zoos, and projects in parts of northern Africa aim to reintroduce them to the wild.",
  "breeding": "We’ve kept scimitar-horned oryxes continuously since 1968, when the first three arrived from Aalborg, Denmark.",
