  "attractions": "Kookaburras are larger relatives of kingfishers and fishers but are less tied to water, often hunting in open, arid landscapes. They perch on elevated spots, scanning for insects and small vertebrates, including snakes, which they kill with their strong, up to 8 cm long beak. Kookaburras are social birds, constantly calling to each other with a harsh, laugh-like voice familiar to Australians. Indeed, the kookaburra is so integral to the Australian landscape that it became a mascot for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Females lay eggs in tree hollows or termite nests. Kookaburras adapt easily to human presence and can be kept in aviaries, living up to 20 years in captivity.",
