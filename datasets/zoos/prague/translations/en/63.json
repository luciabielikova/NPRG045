  "breeding": "A relatively large number of whipsnakes passed through Prague Zoo in the 1950s, but these were transit animals. Visitors could first encounter them in the terrarium of the Indonesian Jungle pavilion, where the first female arrived in 2004. There was a brief breeding break from 2008–2011, but since then, we have not only kept them but also bred them successfully since 2011.",
