  "attractions": "Gila monsters are among the few known venomous lizards worldwide. Found in two species exclusively in southwestern North America and Central America, their venom glands are located in the rear of the lower jaw, with venom flowing through grooves on several pairs of enlarged (up to 5 mm long), pointed teeth. They grip prey tightly to paralyze it. These relatively slow lizards feed on ground-nesting bird chicks, smaller lizards, turtles, rodents, and eggs, consuming up to a third of their body weight at once. They climb skillfully. Active by day, they spend nights in self-dug underground burrows. Females lay eggs without further care. If laid late in summer, the eggs overwinter, hatching after 10 months.",
