  "name": "Variegated Whip Spider",
  "description": "At first glance, members of the Amblypygi order resemble odd, leggy hybrids of scorpions, spiders, and insects. They have strikingly elongated feet on their first pair of legs, used as sensory organs instead of antennae, leaving them with six walking legs. Their flat body is divided into a broad cephalothorax and a relatively short, rounded abdomen. They lack both a venomous stinger like scorpions and venomous chelicerae like spiders.",

  "attractions": "The taxonomy of whip spiders (or tailless whip scorpions) is constantly evolving. Originally, the variegated whip spider was recognized as a species also found in West Africa, but new findings indicate it is a distinct species (or group of species). Whip spiders are nocturnal, and their only defense in danger is rapid escape. They spend the day in vertical crevices, such as under tree bark. They move sideways like crabs, incredibly fast. Some species adapt to human presence, found behind curtains or pictures. Females care for their offspring—initially carrying eggs attached to the underside of their abdomen, later transporting mobile nymphs on their back.",
