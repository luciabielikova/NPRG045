  "proportions": "Body length 2–3.5 m; tail length 50–90 cm; shoulder height 1.2–1.8 m; weight 300–950 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation lasts 250–277 days; 1 calf born.",
  "attractions": "They form large herds, often mixed with zebras and other antelope species. They don’t occupy fixed territories, and there’s no strict social hierarchy within the herd, so conflicts are rare. Only during mating season do males drive off rivals with ritualized threats, mock-charging nearby bushes, grass clumps, or fallen logs. Eland antelopes are easily tamed, and efforts are underway to domesticate them and expand their farming. In some parts of Africa, their resilience makes them far better suited than traditional livestock.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "The first two eland antelopes arrived at Prague Zoo in 1955—females who lived there for three years. Modern breeding began in 2002.",
