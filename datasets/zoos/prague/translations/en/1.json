  "proportions": "Body length 1.4-2.5 m; tail length 90-105 cm; shoulder height 1-1.2 m; weight 120-250 kg",
  "reproduction": "Females are pregnant for 100-119 days, giving birth to 1-6 cubs.",
  "attractions": "Lions are the only big cats that live in groups. African lions are led by one or two dominant males who do not participate in hunting. The hunt is mainly done by females, some of whom wait in ambush while others drive the prey towards them. Males feed first on the kill. Most lions live alone or in small groups, often only young or old males. Indian lions, in contrast, are solitary hunters and only join females for mating or when large prey is taken down.",
  "projects_note": "Lions once inhabited not only Africa but also Asia and Southern Europe. A small population of Indian lions remains in the Gir Forest Reserve in India. In recent years, conservation efforts have focused on these critically endangered lions, with several zoos, including Prague Zoo, contributing to their preservation. Prague Zoo has housed Indian lions since 2004.",
  "breeding": "Lions, including African ones, have been housed in Prague Zoo since before it was open to the public. The first lion, a small female named Šárka, was a gift from the director of the Rebernigg circus and lived in the villa of the zoo's founder, Prof. Jiří Janda, from March 1930.",
