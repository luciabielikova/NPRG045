  "attractions": "They live at the interface of tides, where water levels, salinity, and temperature fluctuate significantly.

Their prominently bulging eyes allow them to scan their surroundings both in water and on land. They can breathe air, not with lungs, but by mixing it with water retained in their gill chambers.",
