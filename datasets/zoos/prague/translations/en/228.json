  "attractions": "This charming South American predator from the small cat group is also known as the tiger cat or oncilla. It stays in trees or dense undergrowth whenever possible, avoiding open spaces. It leads a solitary life. Males occupy relatively large home ranges (up to over 17 km²), while females have much smaller territories.",
  "projects_note": "Listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. It is primarily threatened by deforestation of continuous forests, as it cannot adapt to environmental changes. Population density is very low (around 5 individuals per 100 km²), and any disruption of continuous forests severely limits their ability to meet during mating season. Illegal hunting for its fur adds to the threat.",
  "breeding": "Prague Zoo has kept oncillas since 1997 and was entrusted with managing the European studbook for this species in 2004. They are not commonly kept in zoos; by the end of 2013, only 21 were recorded in Europe.",
