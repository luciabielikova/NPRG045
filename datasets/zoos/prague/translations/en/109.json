  "name": "Rufous Hornbill",
  "description": "Hornbills are striking, robust birds with a large beak topped by a casque. Though it may appear massive, this structure is very light, mostly filled with air, covered by a thin layer of keratin, and reinforced internally by a network of fine bony struts. The rufous hornbill has a rusty neck and underbelly, gray wings, a white tail, a black mask, and a red beak. Chicks are initially black and white.",

  "proportions": "Length 60–65 cm including tail; female weight 1.1–1.6 kg, male weight 1.3–1.8 kg",
  "reproduction": "Lays 2–4 eggs; incubation lasts 35–40 days.",
  "attractions": "Like all hornbills, it lives in permanent pairs. During nesting, the female retreats into a tree hollow, which the male seals, leaving only a small opening to bring her food. After the chicks hatch, the female leaves the hollow after a time, and both parents then feed the young until they fledge, often assisted by older offspring. Its main food is figs, but it also eats insects, catching them even in flight.",
