  "proportions": "Body length 16–17 cm; tail 9–14 cm; wing length 13.5–17.5 cm; weight 196–285 g",
  "reproduction": "1–3 eggs; incubation 22–23 days",
  "attractions": "Though catbirds are passerines, they don’t stand out with melodious voices. As if to compensate, males invest all their energy during courtship into building ornate bowers to attract females. Each species constructs a specific bower shape, decorating it with flowers, feathers, sticks, and anything found nearby. The spotted catbird is a rare exception, as males do not build bowers. Unlike other catbirds, which may woo multiple females with elaborate displays, the spotted catbird male lives in a permanent pair with a female, making lavish courtship unnecessary. The pair jointly defends their nesting territory. If dispersed in dense forest, they call to each other with a peculiar meowing sound. For most of the year, spotted catbirds feed on fruits and flowers, but during nesting, they switch almost exclusively to animal prey.",

  "breeding": "We kept them from 1997 to 2002, when breeding was interrupted by a flood. New spotted catbirds arrived in 2008 from Dvůr Králové nad Labem Zoo. They spend the winter in the zoo’s back area, away from visitor spaces.",
