  "name": "Slow Worm",
  "description": "Though limbless, the slow worm is a lizard, as evidenced by its movable eyelids and multiple rows of belly scales. It has small eyes, an indistinct neck, and a bluntly rounded snout. Females typically have a coppery hue, often with a dark dorsal stripe, while males are more variable. It cannot coil into a tight ball like snakes.",

  "proportions": "Body length 10–23 cm; tail length 10–22 cm; weight 25–75 g",
  "reproduction": "It’s ovoviviparous—gestation lasts 3–4 months, with females giving birth to 5–25 young.",
  "attractions": "The slow worm spends most of its time underground, though it occasionally basks in the sun. It’s most active after rain, foraging only during the day. It hibernates in a torpid state, often in rodent burrows or other shelters. Like lizards, it can autotomize—shedding its tail in danger to escape, with regrowth starting within weeks.",

  "breeding": "Since spring 2014, it inhabits one of the natural terrariums on the Zakázanka trail, which cuts through a rocky massif connecting the zoo’s lower and upper areas.",
