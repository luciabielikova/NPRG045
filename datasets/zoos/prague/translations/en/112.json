  "name": "Eurasian Stone-curlew",
  "description": "It has strong yellowish legs and a yellow-black beak. Most striking are its large, pale eyes, enabling it to see in twilight. Its typically camouflaged, brownish plumage with dense spotting helps it evade notice even in open landscapes, where it spends its days resting pressed to the ground.",
  "spread_note": "Breeds patchily in Europe and western Asia to India, rarely in the Czech Republic; winters in the Mediterranean and Africa.",
  "food": "Invertebrates",
  "food_note": "Insects and other small animals",
  "image_alt": "",
  "proportions": "Length 40–46 cm; wingspan 76–88 cm; weight 290–535 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 1–3 eggs; incubation lasts 24–27 days.",
  "attractions": "It spends its entire life on the ground and flies reluctantly, but when it must, its flight is swift and rapid. Both parents alternate incubating the eggs, laid in a simple ground scrape, and together protect the hatched chicks. These are precocial, downy, and relatively self-sufficient, soon running alongside their parents, who aggressively defend them against larger predators.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "In modern history, we have kept Eurasian stone-curlews since 2003 and bred them since 2008. They appeared at the zoo earlier, but records are incomplete.",
