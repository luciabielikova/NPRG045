  "attractions": "Australian magpies are among the most common and well-known birds in their homeland, often found in urban gardens, parks, or golf courses. No wonder they’ve become mascots for several local sports teams. With their 'magpie-like' black-and-white plumage and behavior, they resemble corvid songbirds, though they are not closely related. Like European ravens or jackdaws, they forage on the ground by walking and are highly intelligent and playful. They live in stable groups of about 20 birds, fiercely defending their territory, which they often occupy for years. In larger groups, some individuals do not breed, instead helping raise others’ young. Renowned for their vocalizations—earning their Czech name—they mimic a wide range of other bird species and environmental sounds, like barking dogs or neighing horses. They form several subspecies, varying in the extent of black and white patches and body size.",
