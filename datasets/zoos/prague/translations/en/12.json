Its flat head, elongated body, and short legs are perfectly adapted for navigating through bushes and dense undergrowth. In its South American homeland, it appears in three color morphs: gray-brown, black, and golden.",

  "breeding": "Prague Zoo has kept these cats since 1993, or more precisely 1995, when a female joined the original male—both from Rotterdam Zoo. This pair managed to raise just one cub in 2000, yet it was a significant breeding success. The pair Jundík (born 2002 in Děčín Zoo) and Amálka (born 2007 in Berlin Zoo) followed, raising their first offspring in 2009, two more in 2011, and their latest cub in September 2013.",
