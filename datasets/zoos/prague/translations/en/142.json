  "proportions": "Length 70–80 cm; wingspan 125–135 cm; weight 1–1.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "2–4 eggs; incubation 24–28 days",
  "attractions": "They nest in colonies of 3–40 pairs on rocky ledges, and historically often on tall old buildings, churches, and towers. They reach sexual maturity in their third year but usually begin nesting at six years old. They can live up to around 25 years.",
  "projects_note": "Listed as a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List. It once inhabited much of Europe, disappearing from there 300 years ago. Colonies outside Morocco and Syria are part of reintroduction projects. Prague Zoo also participates in a program focused on reintroducing them to the Austrian Alps.",
  "breeding": "We have kept Northern Bald Ibises since 1985, with the first successful breeding in 1992. Unfortunately, the flood in August 2002 had a severe impact, as most ibises did not survive the stress of evacuation. Conditions improved after 2005 when the birds were moved to the new African Rocks aviary. The first post-flood chicks were raised in 2006, with more following.",
