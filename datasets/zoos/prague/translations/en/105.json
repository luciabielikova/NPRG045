  "attractions": "In this species, it’s the female that initiates mating by turning her back to the male, lifting her tail, and lowering her quills away from him when in heat. It lives solitarily or in family groups with offspring of varying ages. Newborns have open eyes, developed teeth, and soft quills that soon harden. Initially, they stay in a softly lined burrow bed. Porcupines dig burrows up to 20 meters long themselves, retreating to them for safety and rest, and often use natural rocky shelters.",
