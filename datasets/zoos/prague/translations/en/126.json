  "proportions": "Body length 40 cm; weight 460–600 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 1–2 eggs; incubation lasts 17–19 days.",
  "attractions": "The closest living relative of the flightless dodo, though it hardly resembles it. By day, it flies in small flocks, foraging mostly on the ground. It is monogamous, with pairs typically permanent. It nests on smaller, quieter islands, forming colonies of up to a thousand during this time. Pigeons belong to the order of soft-billed birds, with an unusually soft upper beak, only the tip being truly hard. Herbivorous, their main diet consists of seeds and fruits. Though surprising for Czech species, many tropical pigeons boast vibrant colors rivaling parrots, making them prized ornamental birds for specialized breeders. All soft-billed birds—pigeons, their slimmer relatives the doves, and the robust ground-dwelling crowned pigeons—share unique traits: they lack a preen gland at the tail base, grooming with fine particles from down feathers, and produce 'pigeon milk,' a curd-like substance in their crop to feed their helpless young. Unlike most birds, they drink by immersing their beaks and sucking, rather than scooping and tilting their heads.",
