  "attractions": "Despite its name, it has little in common with crocodiles, except perhaps a love for water. It stays near rivers, often resting on branches overhanging the water. It seeks refuge and food in the water. Caiman lizards are among the few specialists on shelled snails. Their powerful jaws, equipped with short, tile-like 'molars,' act as a nutcracker. They turn the prey in their mouth several times with their tongue, separating sharp shell fragments, which they spit out. For most of the year, they live solitarily, meeting only during mating season. Males often court females in a typically rough manner, yet the female endures unharmed. In the wild, they lay eggs in termite nests, which the termites quickly repair, effectively sealing the eggs inside.",
