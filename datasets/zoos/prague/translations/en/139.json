  "name": "Brown Hyena",
  "description": "Though hyenas may resemble canids at first glance, they are far more closely related to felids and viverrids. Their powerful jaws can crush even hard bones. The brown hyena has a sloping back, robust head, longer fur, and a mane on its neck and back up to 30 cm long, which it can raise. Its base color is dark brown, with a gray head, light brown neck, and darker transverse stripes on its lighter legs.",

  "proportions": "Body length 1.1–1.3 m; tail length 19–26 cm; shoulder height 64–88 cm; weight 37–48 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation 3 months; 2–5 young",
  "attractions": "All hyena species live in family clans, maintaining relationships through scent marks and ritualized behaviors. For brown hyenas, there are two main social structures, both centered on females. In one, a dominant, unrelated male guards the territory and mates with the females; in the other, females mate with roaming males who then leave. Cub care is cooperative—females nurse even non-biological young, and those without cubs help bring food. Communication relies on scent marks, various postures, and vocalizations, including mane-raising.",

  "breeding": "Breeding brown hyenas in zoos is challenging. If cubs are born, they often require artificial rearing due to the mothers’ sensitivity to disturbance. Prague Zoo has kept them since 1967, but until 1972, cubs couldn’t be raised. Later, artificial rearing succeeded, and only subsequently did females begin caring for their young naturally—a rare achievement largely due to a patient keeper who accustomed the females to human presence.",
