  "attractions": "Rare both in the wild and in captivity, little is known about its life. Like other spiny-tailed lizards, it is active during the day and enjoys basking. It becomes lighter in color in the sun and darkens in the cold, as dark coloration better absorbs heat, warming it faster. It lives in colonies and spends nights in burrows it digs itself.",
