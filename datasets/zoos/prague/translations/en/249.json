  "attractions": "Despite its name, it doesn’t inhabit rainforests but rather shrubby savannas. It seeks wetlands and can swim persistently. However, due to the conversion of its habitat into farmland, it’s threatened in many areas. Prague Zoo boasts successful breeding of these peculiar carnivores, known in zoos as difficult to keep. Adults are sensitive to disturbance, and males often kill the young. Bush dogs are social, living in groups of up to 10. They communicate with sharp barks in the undergrowth. They spend the day in dug burrows or other hollows, foraging at dusk and night.",
