  "reproduction": "Gestation 102–138 days; 1–4 young",
  "attractions": "It stays on the ground, moving with hops somewhat like a rabbit. It spends much time digging and repairing a system of burrows inhabited by family groups. Burrows can be up to 5 m long with multiple entrances. The female raises the young in the burrow, while the male defends the territory and often protects young that have left the burrow from predators. Little is known about their wild life as they hide underground during the day and are mainly active at dusk.",
