  "attractions": "Agamas belong to a diverse family of agamids. They inhabit varied environments, from arid Australian interiors to Asian tropical forest canopies, reflected in their appearance. Desert species often have muted colors and flat bodies without crests, while rainforest species feature vibrant colors, many with prominent dorsal crests or keels above the tail. Common traits include diurnal activity, frequent sexual dimorphism, and a diet mainly of small animals, with some also eating plant parts like flowers or fruits. Most are oviparous, though some are ovoviviparous. Like their close relatives, chameleons, many agamas can move each eye independently and change skin color to express mood or condition—e.g., a pregnant female or a territorial male. Color changes also help regulate body temperature, as different hues absorb sunlight variably.",
