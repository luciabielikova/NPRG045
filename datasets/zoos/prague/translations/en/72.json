  "name": "Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake",
  "description": "A robust snake with a large head and a striking pattern that gives it its name. Like all rattlesnakes, it has a rattle at the end of its tail—horny scales that increase in number throughout its life.",
  "spread_note": "Florida and surrounding areas",
  "food": "Live prey",
  "food_note": "Small vertebrates",
  "image_alt": "Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, photo: Tomáš Adamec, Prague Zoo",
  "proportions": "Length up to 2.5 m; weight up to 12 kg",
  "reproduction": "Ovoviviparous",
  "attractions": "Like other rattlesnakes, it spends its life on the ground. During the day, it hides in burrows of other animals, such as armadillos or tortoises, emerging at dusk or night to hunt. It can occasionally be spotted during the day moving between hunting grounds. It locates prey even in complete darkness thanks to two pits near the front of its snout, housing receptors that detect infrared (thermal) radiation.",
  "projects_note": "Though still relatively common in the wild, concerns persist about its future due to human fear of venomous snakes and hunting for its attractive skin pattern, causing a steady decline in its population across its range.",
  "breeding": "We kept these rattlesnakes in 1951 and 1952. After a long break, a new pair arrived in 2012.",
