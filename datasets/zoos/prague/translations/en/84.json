  "attractions": "Waxwings are not common in Czech nature—appearing only as winter guests, and even then only in some years. When they do appear, they’re hard to miss. From their breeding grounds in the northern taiga and mixed forests, they travel to us in huge flocks, often numbering in the thousands, to feast on rowanberries and other berries. They don’t shy away from cities and are very trusting, allowing observation in urban parks at close range during this time. They build a nest of grass and lichens in trees. While only the female incubates the eggs, both parents feed the chicks, supplementing their diet with insects during this period.",
