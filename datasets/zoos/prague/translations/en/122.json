  "attractions": "These are distinctly arboreal monkeys, lounging in small groups on branches with their tails hanging down, carefully plucking young leaves and shoots. To digest tough, low-nutrient food, they have a three-part stomach that can hold up to a third of their body weight, aided by symbiotic bacteria that break down cellulose and neutralize toxins in leaves. In danger, guerezas flee swiftly along branches, leaping long distances with their tails as rudders. They are social and generally peaceful, with loosely organized troops centered around related females, where conflicts are rare. Members call to each other with long cries. Though breeding isn’t strictly seasonal, most females time births for peak food abundance. Newborn guerezas are white with short fur, carried on the mother’s chest, later riding on her back.",

  "breeding": "The first guerezas at Prague Zoo came from the wild in 1969. The first young were born in 1971, but successful rearing began in 1973. From 1999, when the old monkey pavilion was demolished, until 2004, there was a break in breeding. In late 2004, the female Lomela arrived, followed by the female Lucie and male Katanga in 2005, settling on one of the Monkey Islands, where they remain today. Three of their seven offspring born in this group still live in Prague.",
