  "attractions": "Though its appearance might not suggest it, the small Reeves’s muntjac belongs to the deer family. Wild muntjacs inhabit territories marked with preorbital gland secretions, which males defend. In fights, males use their long canines and short antlers, which grow from elongated, fur-covered pedicles. In dense undergrowth, they move through a network of tunnels they’ve trampled. Surprisingly, they are omnivorous, capable of hunting smaller vertebrates, including ground birds. Newborn young are spotted, like European deer, gradually transitioning to the uniform brown coat of adults.",
