  "proportions": "Body length 1.7–2.7 m; tail length 49 cm; wing length 90 cm; weight 90–160 kg",
  "reproduction": "2–11 eggs; incubation 42–46 days",
  "attractions": "The ostrich is the largest living bird today. Though it can’t fly, it’s an exceptional runner, reaching speeds up to 50 km/h (like a racehorse) and able to change direction sharply. Its legs are so powerful it can fend off lions or hyenas with kicks. Ostriches nest on the ground, but unlike their Australian emu or South American rhea relatives, both the male and female care for the eggs. Several females lay massive, up to two-kilogram eggs in a shallow pit. The male then sits on them, relieved by the dominant female at night. Today, ostriches are also seen on farms worldwide, bred for meat and feathers.",

  "breeding": "We’ve kept ostriches with varying breaks since 1971, though anecdotal evidence suggests they were here earlier too.",
