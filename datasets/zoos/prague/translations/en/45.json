  "proportions": "Body length 42–57 cm; tail length 30–143 cm; wing length 45–50 cm; weight 1.6–2.7 kg",
  "reproduction": "Females lay only 2 eggs, which they incubate alone for 24–25 days.",
  "attractions": "Arguses are fascinating birds related to pheasants. They form two subspecies differing mainly in size and chest coloration. During courtship, the male clears a patch in a forest clearing and attracts the female with a striking dance. He spreads his wings with large secondary feathers, forming a shield behind which he is almost entirely hidden, displaying an eye-like pattern. He also raises his long tail feathers and emits a peculiar, muted yet surprisingly far-reaching call. The female lays eggs in a shallow depression in the forest floor, incubating them and raising the chicks alone.",
  "projects_note": "Listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to hunting for feathers and loss of native forests.",
  "breeding": "Visitors first welcomed arguses at the zoo in 1954. From 1982 to 1999, there was a break in keeping these birds. They reappeared afterward, but a significant milestone came in 2005 when a female from Arnhem, Netherlands, paired with a male from 1999. The first chick was successfully raised in 2006, with a total of ten hatched by 2011.",
