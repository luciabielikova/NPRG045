  "attractions": "Outside the breeding season, it forms sizable flocks. It is very hardy, with courtship often beginning in February. The male performs a dramatic display, climbing steeply then diving sharply toward the ground, pulling up just above the surface. During this, it emits a loud, wailing call, earning it the folk name 'kníhora' (wailing bird). The nest is a shallow scrape in the soil. It breeds across most of Europe; some populations migrate to southern Europe and northwestern Africa, while others are resident.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "Records of breeding are unfortunately incomplete—lapwings are documented in 1939 and 1940, then not again until recent times, when five birds arrived from Ohrada Zoo in 2005.",
