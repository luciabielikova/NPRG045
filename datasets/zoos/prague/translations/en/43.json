  "attractions": "This peculiar tree frog boasts a unique skill shared by all flying frogs: when needing to move quickly between trees, it leaps into the air, spreads its legs wide, and extends the webbing between its toes like small parachutes to slow its fall. It adjusts flight direction by shifting leg positions and can even turn to face backward mid-air.",
