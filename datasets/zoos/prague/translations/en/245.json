  "image_alt": "Dalmatian Pelican, photo: Prague Zoo Archive",
  "proportions": "Length 160–180 cm; wingspan 310–345 cm; weight 10–13 kg; beak length 37–45 cm",
  "reproduction": "1–4 eggs; incubation 28–36 days",
  "attractions": "Unlike the great white pelican, it usually hunts alone, catching fish directly with its beak. Nesting colonies can include up to 250 pairs, with nests often reaching significant sizes—1.5 m tall and over 60 cm in diameter.",
  "projects_note": "This species suffered a dramatic population decline in the 19th and 20th centuries, with its once-continuous range now fragmented. In Europe, these stately birds can be found at just a few Balkan Peninsula sites, mainly at breeding grounds in the protected Danube Delta and Little Prespa Lake in Greece, home to their largest colony of nearly 1,000 pairs.",
  "breeding": "We kept the first Dalmatian pelican from 1950–1952. In the 1950s, many pelicans passed through due to transports arranged by Zoocentr Moscow and other carriers. In 1960, two birds arrived, living at the zoo for 11 and 12 years. The foundation for successful breeding was a pair arriving in 1995, raising their first chick that year—a female named Kelly, still at the zoo. A male, Ken, hatched in 1996, also remains part of the successfully breeding group.",
