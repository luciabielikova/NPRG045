  "attractions": "Incredibly, hyraxes are closely related to elephants. Unlike them, however, they are highly agile, adept at climbing rocks, bushes, and trees. As its name suggests, the southern tree hyrax prefers living in trees, often high in the canopy. It’s most active at dawn and dusk, resting on branches during the day and spending nights hidden in tree hollows. Unlike the sociable rock hyraxes that form large groups, tree hyraxes are mostly solitary. Their lifestyle is secretive—you’re more likely to hear them than see them, especially males, who emit a loud, piercing cry at dawn during the dry season. Their presence is also revealed by distinctive latrines at the base of occupied trees. Interestingly, crystallized hyrax droppings are used locally as a vitamin supplement, with folk medicine attributing them healing properties for epilepsy and seizures.",
