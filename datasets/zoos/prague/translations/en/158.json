  "proportions": "Carapace length up to 70 cm; tail length up to 50 cm; weight 20–80 (100) kg",
  "reproduction": "9–61 eggs; incubation 84–142 days",
  "attractions": "It spends most of its time motionless in shallow water, ambushing fish and various other animals. It can stay underwater for up to 50 minutes on a single breath, remaining so still that algae may grow on its shell, aiding its camouflage. It lures prey with a unique bait: a movable, worm-like appendage on the tip of its tongue, irresistible to fish. Though it lacks teeth like all turtles, its sharp, hooked jaws can firmly grasp slippery fish. Keepers must be cautious, as it is remarkably agile, and a larger turtle could bite through a human finger. At night, it leaves its shelter to search for other food, such as carrion. Females bury their eggs in sand up to 50 m from water.",
  "projects_note": "The alligator snapping turtle is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to hunting.",
  "breeding": "The first two turtles arrived in 1955 and 1956 and lived here for over 40 years. Meanwhile, we acquired two females—one in 1995 from Kolín nad Rýnem and one in 1996 from Zurich. Both remain at the zoo today. In 2006, a male arrived from Brno Zoo, and by 2010, we had our first two hatchlings. A third hatched in 2012.",
