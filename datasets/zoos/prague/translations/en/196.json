  "attractions": "The swift parrot is related to rosellas but resembles lorikeets in its feeding habits. It is closely tied to eucalypts, nesting in their hollows and feeding on them. Considered the fastest flier among parrots, its swift, swallow-like flight earned it its name. A male trying to attract a female or intimidate a rival spreads its wings to reveal their red undersides.",
