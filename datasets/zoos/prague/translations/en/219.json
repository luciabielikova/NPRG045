  "attractions": "Maras inhabit a system of burrows that can exceed 5 meters in length. They spend the night there and raise their young. Patagonian maras live in permanent pairs and often share their burrows with other pairs. The young, cared for by both parents, are better protected from predators this way. However, cohabitation isn’t always smooth—the pair that returns first often guards the burrow entrance, sometimes preventing other parents from entering.",
