  "reproduction": "Females are pregnant for 21–24 days, bearing 2–3 young (up to 5 in captivity).",
  "attractions": "It digs a network of burrows under rocky overhangs and large boulders. It forages at night, is very lively and active, and excels at climbing. It lives in family groups whose members often playfully wrestle, groom each other, and sleep huddled together. Pairs are seasonally monogamous, with courtship preceding mating—males drum their hind legs and leave scent marks (from abdominal glands) to attract females, followed by chases and ritualized pushing. In the wild, they breed in February and March. In captivity, successful mating requires a diet high in protein and low in fat.",
