  "food": "Plant parts",

  "proportions": "Body length 1.1–1.3 m; tail length 10–15 cm; shoulder height 40–70 cm; weight 25–55 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation 145–152 days; 1–4 young",
  "attractions": "There are at least 200, possibly over 300, goat breeds worldwide, raised for meat, milk, leather, and wool. Their ancestor is now considered the bezoar goat from Western and Central Asia. Domestication likely occurred 12,000 years ago, and goats quickly became popular domestic animals in many regions due to their low maintenance. Though called 'greedy as a goat,' these ruminant even-toed ungulates can digest a wide range, from thistles to young trees. In the Children’s Zoo, you’ll meet black Cameroon goats, a dwarf breed kept not only for utility but also for enjoyment.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "It’s hard to pinpoint when the first domestic goat was kept at the zoo. Records show Cameroon goats have been here since 1988, though these beloved little goats likely entertained children as early as the 1970s.",
