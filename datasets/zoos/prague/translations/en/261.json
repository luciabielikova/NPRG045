  "attractions": "Unlike other mongooses that lead a terrestrial lifestyle, the slender mongoose can also climb quite skillfully, though it spends most of its day on the ground. It’s largely solitary, and in the wild, you rarely see more than two adults together. At Prague Zoo, you’ll spot it next to the sea lion exhibit—not by chance. Sea lions and their relatives evolved from carnivores similar to mongooses, making our slender mongooses a vivid comparison of nature’s evolutionary paths.",
