  "projects_note": "Listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, it was nearly extinct on its native island in the 20th century. Thanks to captive breeding, it has recovered from the brink, largely due to zoologist and author Gerald Durrell. Prague Zoo’s pink pigeons breed annually, contributing to the EEP conservation program.",
  "breeding": "We acquired our first pair from Durrell Zoo in Jersey in 2000. The first successful breeding occurred in 2001, followed by ten more offspring. Breeding pink pigeons is challenging due to their intolerance.",
