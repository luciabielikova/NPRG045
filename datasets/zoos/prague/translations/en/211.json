  "projects_note": "Unable to adapt to other environments, any landscape alteration is catastrophic for it. Additionally, these mynas were heavily hunted for their appearance as ornamental cage birds. It’s no wonder only a few individuals remain in the wild, and the Rothschild’s myna survives only thanks to captive breeding. The current population is estimated at 500 individuals.",
  "breeding": "Rothschild’s mynas arrived at our zoo in 1975 from Durrell Zoo on Jersey, and the first successful breeding occurred in 1977. To date, over 190 chicks have hatched, most of which were successfully raised.",
