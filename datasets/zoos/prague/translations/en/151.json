  "name": "Ruff",
  "description": "Ruffs are medium-sized waders with remarkable sexual dimorphism. Males differ from females not only in larger size but, during the breeding season, especially by a rich feather ruff around the neck. It can be white, rusty, or nearly black. Together with elongated head feathers, orange bare facial patches, and a black chest spot, it serves as an eye-catching signal during their ostentatious courtship display, attracting females and intimidating rivals.",
  "spread_note": "Breeds in northern Eurasia, winters in western and southern Europe, Africa, South Asia, and Australia",
