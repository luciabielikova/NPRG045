  "image_alt": "Desmarest's hutia, photo: Rostislav Stach",
  "proportions": "Body length 30–50 cm; tail length 15–30 cm; weight 4–7 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation 110–140 days; 1–4 young",
  "attractions": "The hutia may look somewhat clumsy at first glance, but it climbs trees adeptly. Like all rodents, it has continuously growing incisors for nibbling leaves or shoots, supplementing its diet with small animals. A relatively gentle creature, it has suffered due to its tasty meat. Once abundant on Cuba and nearby islands, it is now much rarer. A group of hutias (also known as Cuban hutias) can be found in the so-called America area, next to the ocelot enclosure. They breed regularly here, and watching the playful young is undoubtedly a memorable experience.",
