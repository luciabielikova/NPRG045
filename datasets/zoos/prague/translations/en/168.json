  "name": "Swamp Wallaby",
  "description": "It has a typical 'kangaroo-like' appearance. The front five-toed limbs are short and weak, mainly used for handling food. The hind legs are strong, with a vestigial thumb and partially fused toes, the fourth being the longest and strongest—an adaptation for long, high leaps when fleeing danger. The swamp wallaby has dark brown fur, darker limbs and tail, a lighter yellowish belly, and often a yellow stripe on its cheeks.",
