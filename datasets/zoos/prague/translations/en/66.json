  "proportions": "Body length 12.5–17 cm; weight 150–200 g",
  "reproduction": "Females are pregnant for 62–65 days, with an average litter size of 7–8 young.",
  "attractions": "At first glance, the lesser hedgehog tenrec resembles a hedgehog, but appearances deceive. Current knowledge suggests it has little in common with hedgehogs, with similarities likely due to a similar lifestyle (known as convergent evolution). Tenrecs and their relatives are an ancient group of animals from Madagascar and parts of Africa, distantly related to other primordial African mammals like aardvarks, elephants, hyraxes, and elephant shrews. They are so ancient that they lack some traits typical of placental mammals, such as precise body temperature regulation or separate anal and genital openings (instead having a single cloaca, like birds or marsupials). The lesser hedgehog tenrec is solitary, meeting others of its kind only briefly during breeding. Active at night when foraging, it spends the day hidden in burrows or tree hollows—though primarily terrestrial, it can climb fairly well.",

  "breeding": "Surprisingly, the history of tenrec breeding is quite long. The first individuals arrived in 1977, and we have kept this species continuously since then. Though they bred regularly, the first successful rearing occurred in 2011.",
