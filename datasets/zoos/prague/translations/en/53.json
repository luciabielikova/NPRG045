  "reproduction": "Females lay 5–12 eggs and incubate them for 22 days.",
  "attractions": "Despite the male's vibrant coloration, it escapes notice in the wild by staying in dark juniper thickets, blending with the shadows, so little is known about its wild life. Like all pheasants, it forages on the ground, digging with its strong beak. At night, it roosts in tree canopies. It flies sharply and quickly but prefers to flee and hide in vegetation when threatened.",
