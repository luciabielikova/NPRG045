  "image_alt": "Steller's Sea Eagle, photo: Prague Zoo Archive",
  "proportions": "Body length 74–81 cm; tail length 33 cm; wingspan 118–136 cm; weight 5–9 kg",
  "reproduction": "1–3 eggs; incubation 38–45 days",
  "attractions": "It builds its nest from sticks in tall trees, occasionally on rocky cliffs or forested slopes. A pair typically has 2–3 nests in its territory, used alternately. When hunting fish, it either circles about 5 meters above the water before diving or stands in shallow water.",
  "projects_note": "Its population is estimated at just 5,000 individuals and continues to decline, primarily due to pollution and habitat changes (dam construction, oil extraction, fishing). It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.",
  "breeding": "The first Steller’s sea eagle lived at Prague Zoo from 1952–1976, the second from 1958–1959. The species vanished from our exhibits for a long time until a female arrived from Almaty in 2000, joined by a male from Liberec Zoo in 2006. The pair raised their first chick in 2007 and has nested successfully in subsequent years, even repeatedly raising two chicks.",
