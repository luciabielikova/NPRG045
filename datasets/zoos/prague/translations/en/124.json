  "name": "Secretarybird",
  "description": "The secretarybird is practically unmistakable. It has long legs, a slender body, predominantly gray-white plumage, and elongated feathers on its head that, when fluffed, resemble quills behind a medieval scribe’s ear. Young birds are easily distinguished from adults by their yellow head skin, while adults have red skin.",

  "proportions": "Body length 71–80 cm; tail length 54–70 cm; wingspan 212 cm; weight 2.3–4.3 kg",
  "reproduction": "Lays 2 eggs; incubation lasts 42–46 days.",
  "attractions": "If you expect it to soar majestically to spot prey, you’d be disappointed. Though it can fly, this savanna dweller strides deliberately while hunting (covering 10–20 km daily). You’re more likely to see it in flight during courtship or short hops into acacia branches, where it spends the night and nests. Males and females form a permanent pair, jointly defending their territory. Both parents raise typically two chicks in a massive nest over two meters wide, perched 5–7 meters up in branches.",
