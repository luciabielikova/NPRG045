  "attractions": "The Eurasian siskin is a lively, active bird, most noticeable outside the breeding season when it’s less discreet. From autumn to spring, it often forms small flocks, climbing nimbly in tree crowns, sometimes hanging upside down to peck seeds. Its nest is deeply cup-shaped and well-camouflaged high in trees. Formerly kept as cage birds, siskins are undemanding and adapt easily to human presence.",
