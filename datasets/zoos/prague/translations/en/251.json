  "proportions": "Body length 36–40 cm; tail length 7–8 cm; wing length 21–25 cm; weight 165–205 g",
  "reproduction": "3–6 eggs; incubation 22–26 days",
  "attractions": "It forages at the water-land interface. Its leg length allows it to venture into deeper water inaccessible to other waders. In some areas, stilts are resident; northern populations migrate long distances, forming huge flocks of up to thousands during this time. During breeding, they are monogamous, with both parents building the nest and caring for the young.",
