  "reproduction": "Gestation 114–145 days; 1–4 young",
  "attractions": "Like the giant panda, it has a special 'thumb,' a wrist bone protrusion, though much smaller. It can’t strip bamboo or other plant leaves but pulls branches with its paw using the 'thumb' to nibble them. Its diet includes bird eggs, small animals, sweet fruits, roots, and even lichens. It forages at dusk and night. Living mostly solitary, the female handles all care for the young, preparing a cozy nest in a tree hollow and tending them for at least six months.",

  "breeding": "Red pandas are found right at the zoo entrance, in a rocky enclosure—the first ever built at Prague Zoo, originally for wolves and adapted in 1993. The first two arrived in 1955, but breeding these delicate animals was tough, and they didn’t survive long. The same applied to two pairs arriving in 1964. Success came in the 1970s, though they didn’t breed yet. The first successful breeding was in 2012, with male Akim born to female Marii from Madrid and father Pat from Ústí Zoo.",
