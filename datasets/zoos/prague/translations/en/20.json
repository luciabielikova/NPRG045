  "name": "Hyacinth Macaw",
  "description": "This is the largest parrot species in the world. It has cobalt-blue feathers, a massive black beak, a bright yellow bare eye ring, and a patch near the lower mandible. Males and females are indistinguishable in size or appearance. Juveniles have slightly shorter tails compared to adults.",
  "spread_note": "South Central America to mid-South America, primarily the Amazon",
  "food": "Plant parts",
  "food_note": "Fruits of eight palm species, especially hard nuts",
  "image_alt": "Hyacinth macaw, photo: Tomáš Adamec, Prague Zoo",
  "proportions": "Body length 95–100 cm, with the tail making up at least half; weight 1,200–1,700 g",
  "reproduction": "Females lay 2 eggs, but typically only one chick is raised. Incubation lasts 27–30 days.",
  "attractions": "They live in lifelong pairs, constantly showing affection through vocalizations and mutual preening. During peak activity times—morning and late afternoon—they sometimes gather in groups of up to 10 to fly to food sources. At night, pairs return to their favorite roosting tree. They forage mostly on the ground, though they climb skillfully and can harvest palm fruits high in the canopy. They are key seed dispersers. They nest in tree hollows or suitable cliff crevices. The female incubates the eggs while the male brings her food and feeds her. Chicks stay with their parents for 18 months, maturing between 6–10 years and living an average of 50 years.",
  "projects_note": "Listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to habitat loss (tied to only eight palm species for food) and the capture of live birds.",
  "breeding": "The first hyacinth macaws appeared at Prague Zoo in 1951, but only in transit, unavailable for public viewing. Another trio lived there from 1978 to 1990. After a break, these stunning parrots returned in 2010.",
