  "attractions": "Chevrotains are miniature even-toed ungulates living in several species across Southeast Asia. Their small size makes them easy prey for many predators, so they live very secretively. During the day, they hide in undergrowth, emerging onto clearings only at night to graze. They are solitary. Males are equipped with long canines used for defense and combat with rivals.",
  "projects_note": "The Balabac chevrotain is listed as an endangered species in the IUCN Red Book. This is due to its tiny range (now limited to three small islands, the largest, Balabac, being less than 35 km long), where its natural habitat is giving way to coconut plantations, and hunting for meat. Both factors have caused its wild population to decline—local hunters say it’s now much harder to catch a 'pilandok,' as they call it, than it was 15 years ago.",
  "breeding": "At Prague Zoo, you can see Balabac chevrotains in one of the nocturnal exhibits in the Indonesian Jungle Pavilion. We are one of the few zoos outside the Philippines to keep these small, charming ungulates. A pair arrived from Wroclaw Zoo in 2011. In 2013, three young were raised; one returned to Wroclaw, while two stayed in Prague.",
