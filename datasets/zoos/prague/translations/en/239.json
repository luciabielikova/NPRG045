  "attractions": "Palm civets are civet-like carnivores, with several species inhabiting the forests of southern and southeastern Asia. They stay in lower trees and shrubs, foraging (mostly fruits, occasionally smaller animals) and sleeping there during the day—active at dusk and night. While climbing, they balance with their long tails and use partially retractable claws. The Philippine palm civet is one of many subspecies of the common palm civet, found across tropical Asia. Like all palm civets, it’s solitary, with females raising young alone. Initially, she hides them in tree hollows, later taking them on foraging trips and teaching them to find food. In danger, it employs a 'chemical weapon'—a foul-smelling anal gland secretion that nauseates attackers. This secretion also marks their territory.",
