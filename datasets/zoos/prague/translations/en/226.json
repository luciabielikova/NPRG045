  "attractions": "These diurnal carnivores are highly active and agile. They climb skillfully in branches or scamper on the ground with their tails raised like exclamation marks. With their snouts, they curiously explore every crevice for something to eat. Using their front paws with long claws, they dig up soil, turn over stones and logs, and sift through fallen leaves in search of various treats. While male coatis prefer a solitary life, females with young form relatively large groups. After birth, the young hide in tree hollows or nests in trees, developing quickly and soon climbing and running as adeptly as adults.",

  "breeding": "The first coati was kept from 1931–1935, though we lack records of its origin. The second, arriving in 1932 from Karl’s Circus, is documented. Coatis were then kept almost continuously until 1960, followed by a long break. In 1990, a female passed through en route to Copenhagen Zoo. The current breeding began with coatis arriving in 2001, including a female, Teta, still at the zoo. The first successful breeding occurred in 2003.",
