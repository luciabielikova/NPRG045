  "name": "Steppe Tortoise",
  "description": "As a typical terrestrial tortoise, it has a domed shell. The carapace is predominantly yellow-brown with darker markings; the plastron is almost entirely black.",
  "spread_note": "From the Caspian Sea eastward to Pakistan",
  "food": "Plant parts",
  "food_note": "Grass, herbs, fruits",
  "image_alt": "",
  "proportions": "Carapace length 15–25 cm; weight 0.5–3 kg; males are smaller than females",
  "reproduction": "Females lay 2–6 eggs, often twice per season; incubation lasts 60–110 days.",
  "attractions": "It spends unfavorable periods—winter cold and summer heat, up to 9 months a year—in torpor within burrows that can extend up to 12 meters. During vigorous courtship, males frantically circle females, bump them with their shells, and bite them. Males also engage in shoving contests.",
  "projects_note": "The steppe tortoise inhabits a vast range but faces various threats, earning it a vulnerable status on the IUCN Red List. Historically, it was threatened by direct hunting for meat and the pet trade, with hundreds of thousands exported globally until recently. Additional threats include steppe plowing and intensive cattle grazing. Populations are fragmented by road construction, and despite conservation efforts, its future remains uncertain.",
  "breeding": "Records of the first steppe tortoises at Prague Zoo are incomplete, but individuals appeared as early as the 1960s. Since 2011, the zoo has exhibited several from a larger group seized by the Czech Environmental Inspectorate and placed in the zoo’s CITES rescue center. We currently keep the subspecies T. h. kazachstanica.",
