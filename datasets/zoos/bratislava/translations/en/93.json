  "attractions": "The lesser redpoll was once considered a light form of the common redpoll but is now recognized as a distinct species that breeds in our region. Though lively and restless, it lives discreetly, revealing itself mainly through its voice—rattling tones and a characteristic 'che-che-che.' Redpolls are sociable, foraging at tree canopy edges and gathering in large numbers at roosts. During nesting, however, they are monogamous. The female builds the nest and incubates the eggs, while the male brings her food.",

  "breeding": "It is more than likely that the zoo’s founder, Prof. Janda, kept redpolls. However, the first documented arrival was in 2005, when they settled in one of the aviaries of the 'Nature Around Us' exhibit.",
