  "image_alt": "Chuckwalla, photo: Petr Velenský, Prague Zoo",
  "proportions": "Body length 28–43 cm, with tail length at least 50% of total length; weight up to 350 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 4–14 eggs; incubation lasts 72–93 days.",
  "attractions": "The chuckwalla is a diurnal lizard superbly adapted to desert conditions. It survives cooler periods in a state of torpor. Its smooth, flat body and flexible spine allow it to swiftly escape predators into rock crevices, where it inflates itself to wedge in place. During mating season (April to July), males temporarily become territorial, establishing a social hierarchy based on overall size. Females typically lay eggs once every two years, burying them in the soil.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "Though there’s a record of one specimen in 1974, breeding began in 2004 when five individuals arrived, four from the wild. That same year, they started reproducing, and by the end of 2013, 111 hatchlings had emerged.",
