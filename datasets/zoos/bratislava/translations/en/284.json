  "attractions": "This is a forest-dwelling vulture, nesting primarily in trees or on rocky ledges. Both parents take turns incubating the egg and feeding the chick. Vultures serve as nature’s “health police”—they soar over the landscape, using their excellent eyesight to locate animal carcasses, which they feed on, thus helping to clear them away. They utilize the remains so thoroughly that only bones are left, and even rotting meat, inedible to other animals, poses no problem for them.",
  "projects_note": "The Cinereous Vulture is disappearing from most of its range and is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.",
  "breeding": "Cinereous Vultures have been traditionally bred here. The first pair arrived in 1933 from the Kludský Circus, with the male living in the zoo for 20 years. The first successful breeding occurred in 1992, followed by more.",
