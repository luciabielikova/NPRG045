  "attractions": "Oryxes are robust antelopes with long, straight or slightly curved horns. Both males and females have them, with no color difference between sexes. The beisa oryx has straight horns up to 1.5 m long. It manages water exceptionally well, surviving for periods without drinking. It can also raise its body temperature to 46.5°C during hot daytime hours. Adult males live solitarily most of the year, joining herds of females and young only during the rut. These herds, up to 40 strong, are usually led by the most experienced female. Young follow their mother immediately after birth.",
