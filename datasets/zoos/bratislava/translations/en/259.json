  "attractions": "Dormice of the genus Graphiurus are small rodents from sub-Saharan Africa. You’d find the savanna dormouse in open landscapes with shrubs and rocky outcrops or dry, light forests. It places its spherical nest, where it spends the day and raises young, in a tangle of branches at varying heights above ground. It forages at dusk and night, both on the ground and in bushes, climbing skillfully. At Prague Zoo, we keep this attractive creature in the Africa Up Close pavilion, where you can peek into its nest through a window.",
