  "reproduction": "Females lay 5–17 eggs; incubation lasts 76–86 days.",
  "attractions": "An exclusively terrestrial species, it digs burrows. Females occupy fixed territories, while the male forms a loose harem-like bond with them, fiercely defending his mates from other males.",
  "projects_note": "Once abundant on its native island, Cuban iguanas are no longer so. Like many island species, they suffer from direct hunting, loss of breeding habitat, and dwindling food sources. Prague Zoo joined the fight for their survival, successfully breeding offspring in 1993—the first in Europe and second worldwide.",
  "breeding": "A male named Pepíno, arriving with his mate in 1992, is considered the founder of the lineage here. During his lifetime, he saw not only grandchildren but also great-grandchildren born at the zoo. Due to these exceptional successes, Prague Zoo was tasked in 1995 with coordinating the breeding of Cuban iguanas and maintaining their studbook.",
