  "projects_note": "The eastern mountain bongo is a subspecies found only in Kenya. Sparse populations survive in just four isolated locations in highland forests, such as the slopes of Mount Kenya. The total wild population is estimated at just 100 individuals, making it one of the most endangered large mammals. It is classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.",
  "breeding": "The first pair, male Wajir and female Kindu, arrived at Prague Zoo in 1988. At that time, bongos had a reputation as dangerous and unpredictable antelopes. However, the zoo’s approach, fostering their natural curiosity, soon revealed them as highly intelligent creatures capable of adopting keepers into their close family. Since breeding began, 44 have been born in Prague. The current breeding group consists of females Maureen and Miagi from Prague breeding, their two calves (both males), two young females from Berlin Zoo, and breeding male Chadim from Dvůr Králové Zoo.",
