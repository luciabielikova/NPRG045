  "proportions": "Length 40–50 cm (tail 16–25 cm); weight 0.3–0.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "Females lay 2 eggs, incubating them alone for 18–20 days.",
  "attractions": "It lives rather secretively, so little is known from the wild. Courtship is elaborate, with the male attracting the female not only with a peculiar dance—tilting his crest and fanning his tail—but also by bringing food. The female then builds the nest alone and incubates the eggs.",
  "projects_note": "Its native forests are disappearing rapidly due to logging, and the pheasant’s numbers are declining fast. It enjoys strict international protection and is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List.",
  "breeding": "These pheasants have appeared at the zoo twice. We kept them from 1963–1973 and then again since 1988. The first chicks were successfully raised in 1995.",
