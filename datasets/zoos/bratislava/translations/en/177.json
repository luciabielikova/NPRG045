  "attractions": "Bushbabies resemble forest sprites. These prosimians inhabit shrubby and sparsely wooded plains. They sleep quietly during the day, curled into a ball, and set out at dusk to search for ripe fruits, flowers, sap, and especially insects, which they catch with their paws. They particularly seek out grasshoppers and locusts, settling comfortably to eat their prey, holding it in their hands and nibbling gradually. In dry seasons when insects are scarce, they switch to plant food, mainly sap, enabling survival in arid areas. With large ears, moistened regularly with their own urine and folded against the head during sleep, they detect every rustle. In danger, they escape with long leaps, propelled by strong hind legs, landing on branches or trunks and gripping firmly with all four limbs. Their bushy tails maintain balance during jumps. Bushbabies live in small family groups. Females bear well-developed young, which spend their first days in nests of grass and leaves.",
