  "proportions": "Body length 10–20 cm; tail length 10–15 cm; weight 40 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 2–13 eggs; incubation lasts 45–86 days.",
  "attractions": "Extremely heat-loving, it can move across rocks heated to 60°C. It remains active even during the hottest hours, hunting prey of various sizes, including other reptiles nearly as large as itself. To cool off on scorching rocky ground, it lifts its legs alternately, standing on just two at a time. When threatened, it can rear up and flee on its hind legs, similar to basilisks or anoles. Males often perch on elevated rocks for a perfect view of their territory. During courtship or to defend their territory from rival males, they perform conspicuous movements—push-ups, arching their backs sharply, and inflating their throats.",
