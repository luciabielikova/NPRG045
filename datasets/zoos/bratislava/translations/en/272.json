  "attractions": "The older name 'marsh antelope' perfectly captures this African bushbuck’s lifestyle. It seeks out riverbanks, lakeshores, wet savannas, or vast wetlands. To avoid sinking into soft ground, it has unusually long hooves and dewclaws that spread out like snowshoes to distribute its weight. It forms herds mainly of females and young, while males live solitarily most of the year. In danger, it flees into water.",
