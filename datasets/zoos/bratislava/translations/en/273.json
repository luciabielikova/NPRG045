  "attractions": "Tarantulas are a group within the spider order. Their body is divided into a cephalothorax and abdomen, connected by a narrow pedicel, with four pairs of segmented legs and usually four pairs of simple eyes. Tarantulas don’t hunt with webs but ambush prey. Widely spaced eyes provide a broad field of vision. They kill prey with venom injected via chelicerae with sharp fangs, simultaneously injecting digestive juices that break down the prey’s tissues, which the spider then sucks up as liquid. Most tarantulas are nocturnal, spending the day in a nest—an underground burrow lined with silk or an above-ground silk nest hidden under stones or tree bark. During breeding, the female lays eggs in a silk cocoon, guarding it until the young hatch. The brick-red baboon spider hides in underground burrows under kapok tree roots or various shrubs during the day, digging them with its strong hind legs. It’s quite aggressive, adopting a threatening posture with raised chelicerae and a hissing sound—produced by rubbing hairs on its front legs—at any threat. At night, it’s active, hunting and expanding its underground tunnels.",
