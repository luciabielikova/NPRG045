  "image_alt": "Abdim’s stork, photo: Ian White",
  "proportions": "Body length 59–63 cm; tail length 16–18 cm; wingspan 140 cm; weight 1–1.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "Females lay 2–3 eggs; chicks hatch after 30–31 days (data from captivity).",
  "attractions": "Though migratory, it never strays far from Africa. It breeds north of the equator and then migrates south. It seeks burning savannas, feeding on insects fleeing the fire. One of the few large birds favored by locals, as its preferred food—migratory locusts—destroys crops. It nests at the start of the rainy season (May) in colonies on cliffs or trees, often with other species.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "Abdim’s storks appeared at the zoo from 1951–1953, but Praguers could see them again only from 1996. The first breeding succeeded in 2004, followed by 14 more offspring.",
