  "projects_note": "The white-winged duck relies on mature trees. It once inhabited a vast range from northeastern India to Sumatra and Java. Due to intensive deforestation, wetland drainage, dam construction, and other environmental impacts, their numbers declined, with the current population estimated at just 400–450 birds. Its range is now fragmented into isolated subpopulations with little chance of interaction. It’s listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.",
