  "proportions": "Body length 41–43 cm; tail length 22–24.5 cm; weight 0.9–1.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "2–6 eggs; incubation 19–21 days",
  "attractions": "It flies excellently, sometimes covering greater distances with gliding or soaring, enabled by its broad wings. It emits a characteristic hoarse croak and can mimic the human voice well. It lives in permanent pairs. It nests early in spring, returning to the same spot for years. The nest, made of twigs, grass, and moss, is built in trees or on inaccessible cliffs. The female usually incubates, and both parents feed the chicks. Until recently rare in our nature, ravens are now increasing.",

  "breeding": "Common ravens were among the animals Prague Zoo received before its opening. In 1922, two ravens from Warsaw were kept by Prof. Janda with many other animals in his garden. In 1939, ravens from Kaunas arrived, but records thereafter are incomplete, though anecdotes confirm ravens have always been part of the zoo. The current pair, Klára and Kryštof, came from Plzeň Zoo in 2003 and have since regularly heralded spring with their nesting.",
