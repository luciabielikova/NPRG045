  "proportions": "Body length up to 250 cm; tail 20–25% of length; weight up to 2 kg",
  "reproduction": "Lays 5–13 eggs; incubation lasts 86–129 days.",
  "attractions": "It always stays near water, especially favoring warm, humid mangrove wetlands and thickets. It swims very well and can catch fish. It spends the day hidden in bushes with its slit-like pupil contracted, expanding at night to hunt birds, small mammals, lizards, and frogs. Unlike vipers, it lacks front fangs but has enlarged rear teeth with grooved surfaces, through which venom flows from a special gland when gripping prey. Its venom is relatively mild, and though highly aggressive and quick to bite, the effects are rarely fatal to humans.",
