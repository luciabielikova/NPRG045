  "attractions": "A sturdy body, short legs, and especially a long beak with a flexible pouch on the lower jaw are typical features of all pelicans. This pouch is incredibly stretchable, holding up to 13 liters, though delicate and used only for catching fish, not carrying them. Different pelican species employ varied hunting tactics—some herd fish into shallows in groups, others hunt alone on the surface, and some spot prey from the air before diving headlong. Pelicans live and nest in colonies, with some building massive ground nests and others in tree crowns. Parents feed their young with pre-digested fish, a semi-liquid mix the chicks retrieve from the parents’ pouches. All pelicans are excellent fliers and can be found far from water. Great white pelicans often hunt together, driving fish into shallows in a line to catch them. They nest in colonies, with large stick nests built near water on the ground.",
