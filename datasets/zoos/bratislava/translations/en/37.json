  "proportions": "Length 2.5–4.5 m, with about 20% being the tail; weight up to 8 kg",
  "reproduction": "Ovoviviparous; females are pregnant for about 7 months, giving birth to 2–10 young.",
  "attractions": "It hunts on the ground, in trees, and in caves, where it spends winter months. It can grip firmly with its tail to catch a flying bat. Active at night, its large eyes aid in navigation, supplemented by thermoreceptors—pits on the upper jaw—that detect infrared (heat) from small mammals or birds.",
  "projects_note": "It faces typical island species challenges: survival is threatened by introduced animals and ongoing habitat destruction. Many species are protected, with breeding programs in zoos. Prague Zoo is globally among the most successful breeders of Cuban boas, entrusted with coordinating the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) and maintaining the studbook for this species.",
  "breeding": "The first Cuban boas arrived at the zoo in 1963 and 1965 directly from Cuba. More joined in 1990, and since 1993, the zoo has bred this species regularly, producing over 90 offspring by 2013.",
