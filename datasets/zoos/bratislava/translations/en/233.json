  "proportions": "Carapace length 60–80 cm; tail length 5–10 cm; weight 5–20 (up to 50) kg",
  "reproduction": "5–15 eggs; incubation 4–5 months",
  "attractions": "It ranks among the largest freshwater turtles in the world. Despite its size, it eludes attention, and we know little about its life. It lives discreetly in deeper waters, hiding under banks or in tangles of plants.",
  "projects_note": "Listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. Though officially protected, this is often ignored in Asia. Huge numbers end up in markets, and their eggs are collected in large quantities. Deforestation for palm oil plantations poses another threat. In their Malaysian homeland, a rescue station in Setiu aids turtle conservation, allowing eggs to hatch safely.",
  "breeding": "Our turtles come from a group of ten thousand of several species seized in Hong Kong in late 2011 on a ship illegally transporting them to Chinese markets. Prague Zoo took in 27 turtles in very poor health. The excellent work of our keepers is evident—only one of these debilitated turtles died. Two males and one female stayed in Prague, while the rest, after recovery, went to other zoos. In 2007, we successfully raised three hatchlings, with a fourth in 2008. All still live at our zoo.",
