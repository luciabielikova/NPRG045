  "attractions": "Lorikeets are a unique group of parrots that have taken a liking to sweet floral nectar. To feed on this specialized diet, they have a modified tongue tip that forms a brush-like structure. When collecting nectar, they also transfer pollen to other flowers, making them significant pollinators. However, this doesn’t mean they disdain sweet fruits or seeds. When eating these, the fine projections on their tongue tip are tucked into a small pouch. Lorikeets are social birds, with flocks consisting of pairs that stay together permanently. However, they are intolerant of other bird species that visit flowering trees and drive them away.",
