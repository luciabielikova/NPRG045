  "attractions": "The squirrel monkey is an agile little primate that spends most of its day foraging high in tree canopies in groups of up to 50 individuals. It moves through branches with leaps, steering with its long tail, which, unlike many other South American monkeys, is not prehensile. They feed on sap, flowers, fruits, and insects, often deftly catching flying insects with their forepaws. Troops consist of females, usually several males, and young. During mating season, males engage in fierce fights. Squirrel monkeys communicate with a wide range of vocalizations, including bird-like chirps. They sometimes form mixed groups with other monkey species, most often capuchins.",
