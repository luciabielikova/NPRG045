  "proportions": "Body length 42–60 cm; tail length 29–36.5 cm; wingspan 168–244 cm; weight 3–6.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "1–4 eggs; incubation 35 days",
  "attractions": "This impressive raptor with striking contrast coloring is a symbol of the United States. It’s an integral part of the landscape, especially during courtship, when both partners perform dazzling aerial acrobatics—spiraling high, spinning around each other, sometimes plummeting locked by their talons, only to soar again at the last moment. They nest in the crowns of solitary trees, preferably conifers, reusing the same nest for years (typically 5–13, though one used for 30 years weighed 2 tons). The female mostly incubates, but both parents care for the young. They communicate with a peculiar twittering call or a piercing scream to warn of danger or mark territory. They typically live 20–22 years, up to 47 in captivity.",
  "projects_note": "Recently, bald eagles’ fate has been uncertain, with many populations suffering from landscape changes and an unknown disease affecting their flight ability.",
  "breeding": "The first two male bald eagles arrived at Prague Zoo in 1978, followed by a female 9 years later and another in 1993. The first chick arrived in 1995, with successful rearing recorded a year later.",
