  "attractions": "It is a hardy inhabitant of the higher altitudes of the Andes and rugged Patagonia. In winter, rheas form small groups, but during breeding season, flocks disband, and males solitarily care for eggs and young. An adult male first performs an elaborate dance to attract several females, who lay eggs in a shared nest. The male builds this nest, a simple pit in the ground lined with twigs and grass. Eventually, he may incubate up to 60 eggs. The chicks hatch within three days, despite the females laying over 10 days.",
