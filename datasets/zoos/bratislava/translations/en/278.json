Dense fur protects them from the cold, and long, wide hooves prevent them from sinking into deep snow. The rare Karelian subspecies lives wild in Finland and Russian Karelia. In Finland, this subspecies was completely wiped out at the beginning of the 20th century and only began to spread back into its original homeland from Russia starting in the late 1940s.",
