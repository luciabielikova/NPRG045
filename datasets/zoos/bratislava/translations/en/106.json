  "proportions": "Body length 70–90 cm; tail length 8–13 cm; weight 13–27 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation averages 118 days; 1–4 young are born.",
  "attractions": "When threatened, it raises the longer quills on its back and rattles its tail, producing a sound. It doesn’t shoot its quills but can swiftly turn, back up sharply, and strike an attacker with its erect quills. Since the quills are loosely attached, they easily detach, lodging in the predator’s skin and causing painful, often infected wounds. It lives solitarily, in pairs, or family groups, hiding by day in rock crevices, caves, or burrows.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "The first Indian crested porcupines arrived in 1942 from Tilburg, with several more in the 1950s. Records are incomplete, so the origin of offspring born in 1972, for example, is unclear. The record holder at Prague Zoo was a male named Ferdinand, born in August 1981 and died in May 2012, nearly 31 years old.",
