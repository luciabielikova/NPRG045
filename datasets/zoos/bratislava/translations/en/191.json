  "proportions": "Body length 10–11.5 cm; tail length 5.5–6.5 cm; wingspan 45 cm; weight 55–80 g",
  "reproduction": "3–8 eggs; incubation 28 days",
  "attractions": "It lives secretively but likes to perch on treetops, where you might spot it, recognizable by the twitching of its relatively long tail among other signs. It inhabits old mountain forests and is a remnant of the Ice Age in our region—a so-called glacial relict. Its main range lies in the northern taiga, spreading to Central Europe with Quaternary glaciation. As the glacier receded, isolated populations remained in cooler mountain zones, though it is now expanding into foothills and lower altitudes. Pygmy owls live in pairs. During courtship, both partners emit a soft, yet audible whistle. They nest in tree hollows, often taking over woodpecker nests. Both parents feed the chicks.",
