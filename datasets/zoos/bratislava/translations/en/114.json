  "image_alt": "Fennec fox, photo: Tereza Mrhálková, Prague Zoo",
  "proportions": "Body length 36–40 cm; tail length 18–30 cm; shoulder height 18–22 cm; weight 1–1.5 kg",
  "reproduction": "Gestation lasts 51 days; 2–5 young are born.",
  "attractions": "Its light fur not only camouflages it but also effectively reflects sunlight. Its paws are furred underneath to prevent sinking into loose sand, and its prominent ears act as a cooling heat exchanger, lined with long hairs to keep sand out during storms. Thanks to these large ears, the fennec hears every rustle, ensuring no larger insect escapes it during nocturnal hunts.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "Fennec foxes are very demanding and delicate to breed, making it a success that the first individual, arriving from the wild in 1939, lived at the zoo for two years. In the 1950s and 60s, many passed through, but records of their fates are mostly lost. Since then, fennecs have appeared in zoo breeding with short breaks, and the first documented successful breeding occurred in 1998.",
