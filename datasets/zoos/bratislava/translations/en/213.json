  "breeding": "The history of keeping Barbary macaques dates back to the zoo’s beginnings. In 1934, the death of a female was recorded, though details of her arrival or age are missing. They reappeared in 1960, when three arrived from Paris Zoo. From 1969, there was a 20-year gap until 1989, when we imported two pairs—one from Chomutov Zoopark, the other from Morocco via Ravensden. These left in 1998 due to the planned demolition of the monkey pavilion, and new animals settled into the updated exhibit with ungulates in 2000.",
