  "name": "East African Springhare",
  "description": "At first glance, it captivates with its large eyes, massive head, long tail, and especially the disproportion between its front and hind limbs. While the five-toed front legs are short and weak, the four-toed hind legs are strikingly long and strong.",

  "attractions": "Springhares spend the day in underground tunnels they dig themselves, which can exceed 40 meters in length. The tunnel entrances are usually sealed with earth during the day by their owner. At night, they venture out to forage—plant parts and occasionally insects. When they find food, they grasp it with their front paws, sit on their hind legs, and quickly nibble. In danger, they flee swiftly, leaping up to 4 meters in a single bound. They prefer a solitary life or living in pairs, but during nocturnal wanderings, they tolerate larger numbers amicably. Parental duties fall solely to the female, who typically bears one well-developed young that spends its first days in the burrow.",
