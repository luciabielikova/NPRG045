  "reproduction": "Gestation 19 days; 1 young",
  "attractions": "As its species name suggests, the ground cuscus is somewhat of an outlier among cuscuses. While it climbs well, it forages (mainly fruits, occasionally small animals) at least as often on the ground as in branches. Its daytime nest is also ground-based. It retreats to heights mainly when threatened. The female’s pouch opens forward, and the young stays in it for about 108 days.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "The first ground cuscus arrived in 2001—a female joined by a male in 2004. This pair produced 11 offspring.",
