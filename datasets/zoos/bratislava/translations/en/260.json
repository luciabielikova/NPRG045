  "attractions": "A diving duck, it can submerge quite deeply while foraging but prefers shallow coastal waters, rarely venturing onto open water. It often collects food from the surface or in shallow water. Besides seeds and other parts of aquatic plants, it feeds on aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, and small fish. Once, breeding ferruginous ducks could be observed in our waters, but today it’s a rarity to spot one. They typically stay in pairs or small groups, apart from other duck species, though larger flocks may be seen at wintering sites. The nest, made of plant material and lined with down, is placed in dense vegetation on the ground or in reeds over water.",
