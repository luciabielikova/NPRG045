  "attractions": "It is said that cats do not like water. This is not at all true of the fishing cat. It is almost at home in the water and chooses to live in areas where there are plenty of water bodies – the surroundings of streams or dead arms of rivers, flooded forests, swamps or reed beds. It can swim very well (and can swim considerable distances) and skillfully hunts fish and other aquatic animals. It ripples the water surface with its paw to attract prey, and then pulls it out with its claws. Sometimes it lurks on a branch above the water and literally dives head first after the prey, where it grabs it with its teeth. Like the vast majority of felines, the fishing cat is solitary. It spends the day in hiding and goes out to hunt in the morning and evening.",
