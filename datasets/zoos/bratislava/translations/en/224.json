  "breeding": "The first yellow-billed storks appeared at the zoo in 1974. These were wild birds that arrived at Dvůr Králové Zoo via famous African animal transports, with two sent to Prague, one living until 1982. We didn’t keep them again until 2002, when two pairs arrived, one of which still lives at the zoo. The first chicks were successfully raised in 2011, and they have bred regularly since.",
