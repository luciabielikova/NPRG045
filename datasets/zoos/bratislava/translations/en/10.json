  "name": "Caracal",
  "description": "It has a uniform tawny to reddish coloration (there is also a black form), a slender body, a short tail and long legs. Typical are the long tufts of dark hairs at the tips of the auricles and the black lines on the face.",
  "spread_note": "Africa except for the Sahara and the Congo Basin, across the Arabian Peninsula to western Asia",
  "food": "Live prey",
  "food_note": "Smaller vertebrates including birds, porcupines or small antelopes",
  "proportions": "Body length 60–91.5 cm, tail length 23–31 cm, shoulder height 38–50 cm, weight 13–19 kg",
  "reproduction": "The female is pregnant for 69–78 days, giving birth to 2–4 young.",
  "attractions": "Although the caracal may resemble a lynx by the tufts of hair on its auricles, it is actually closely related to servals. The caracal's fur perfectly camouflages it in the open dry landscape. It is well adapted to life in places where water is scarce and manages the fluids contained in food very efficiently. It is extremely agile and strong, moves deftly between steep boulders and jumps and climbs well. Therefore, it can also hunt down elusive hyraxes. Its frequent prey is also birds, which it often catches with a single jump directly in flight. It even overcomes animals that are quite large in relation to its body, such as storks. Adult caracals are solitary and males defend their territory, but the young often stay together until they mature.",

  "breeding": "Caracals have been kept in Prague Zoo in three periods. First from 1961 to 1971, then from 1982−1989 and then from 2004 to the present. However, most of the animals from the 1960s belonged to the so-called transit species. They traveled to various European zoos from the Moscow Zoocenter via Prague. Only a pair from Brno Zoo stayed with us for five years (1966−1971). Breeding in human care is not very common in these graceful predators. In Prague Zoo, two young have been successfully bred so far – in 2009 and 2010. Their parents are the female Karkulka (born 2006 in Animal Park) and the male Karkuš (born 2008 in Tierpark Berlin).",
