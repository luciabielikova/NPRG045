  "attractions": "It lives in permanent pairs, and after breeding, pairs gather into large flocks. The courtship dances of cranes have captivated humans since ancient times and are part of an elaborate display. The dance includes a variety of almost balletic movements—mutual bowing, wing-spreading, leaps, hops, and spins, accompanied by graceful neck and leg motions. During the dance, they also pick up sticks with their beaks and toss them into the air. Unmated individuals dance more skillfully and with greater effort than paired cranes. For paired cranes, the dance primarily serves to prevent mutual aggression and strengthen their bond.",

  "breeding": "In 1955, two blue cranes passed through the zoo during transit, but it wasn’t until 1984 that birds arrived to stay in the exhibit. The female Káča lived at the zoo until 2003. The first chick was successfully raised in 1987, though artificially. In 1989, Káča and her partner naturally raised one offspring, repeating the success in 1990. The female from that clutch, named Julča by keepers, still lives at the zoo.",
