  "breeding": "Since 1959, binturongs intermittently inhabited the Rare Animals Pavilion (now Africa Up Close) until 1994. After a break, new animals arrived at the Indonesian Jungle pavilion. The first was a female from Hanoi in 2005, followed by a pair in 2006 and another female in 2007. The male from that pair still lives; in 2013, he was transferred to another zoo due to the arrival of a new subspecies. The first successful breeding occurred in 2009 with twins, followed by nine more offspring. In early 2014, a pair of Palawan binturongs (A. b. whitei) settled in the pavilion.",
