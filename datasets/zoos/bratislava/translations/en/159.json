  "attractions": "They are social mammals living in colonies ranging from 20 to several thousand individuals. They rest in caves or similar damp, dark places during the day and fly out at night to forage. They navigate not only by sight but also partially by ultrasound (echolocation), though not as precisely as true bats. They produce sounds with their tongues, detecting echoes with their ears. During breeding, partners attract each other with scent signals. Females initially carry their young on their bellies, later leaving them in a sort of 'nursery' with the offspring of other colony females.",
