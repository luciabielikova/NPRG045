  "name": "Bateleur",
  "description": "The African bateleur is one of the most colorful and graceful raptors in the world. Besides its reddish back, black head and flight feathers, and red legs, beak base, and eye area, it is also distinguished by an unusually short tail, often invisible beneath folded wings. Young differ so much from adults that they hardly seem the same species—entirely inconspicuous brown with bluish-green legs and faces, turning brown later and scarlet only in adulthood.",

  "proportions": "Body length 48 cm; tail length 12 cm; wingspan 187 cm; weight 1.8–3 kg",
  "reproduction": "1 egg; incubation 52–59 days",
  "attractions": "You might spot it on savannas, flying low over the ground, combing the landscape for something to eat. It primarily hunts small mammals and birds, descending to prey in a tight spiral. Adult pairs defend a fixed territory, but young birds are nomadic, gathering in groups of up to fifty at rich food sources—like termite mounds during swarming.",

  "breeding": "Visitors could observe bateleurs at the zoo from 1955–1958 and again from 1960–1962. After a 30-year break, a pair arrived in 1992 from the wild, successfully nesting in 1997. The female died a year later, but the male remains at the zoo. In 2007, he paired with a wild female from Tierpark Berlin.",
