  "attractions": "The bronze featherback is a relatively slow fish, preferring calm waters. During the rainy season, it migrates to flooded forests to spawn. It can survive briefly in brackish water. Active at night, it seeks daytime shelter among submerged vegetation or under logs. A sought-after game fish, itâ€™s also popular with aquarists, though juveniles are sensitive to water quality. It behaves territorially toward other featherbacks but coexists well with different fish species.",
