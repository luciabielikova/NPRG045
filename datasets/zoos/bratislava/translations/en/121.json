  "attractions": "Domestication of this species produced the llama. Its dense, fine fur perfectly protects it from cold and blends into the dry highland pampas and semi-deserts. Adult male guanacos defend a territory large enough to sustain themselves, several females, and their young. In danger, they rely primarily on their swift legs. During intraspecies skirmishes, however, they follow a ritual: first intimidating and threatening intruders to drive them away. If unsuccessful, physical confrontations ensue, also ritualized and peculiar among camelids. Kicking and biting, their defenses against predators, are a last resort. Rivals spit at each other, hitting targets with incredible accuracy from 2–3 meters.",
  "projects_note": "Once abundant, their numbers have sharply declined due to hunting and competition with domestic animals.",
  "breeding": "The first guanacos at Prague Zoo are recorded from 1945–1948, though we lack details of their fate. We know the first recorded young was born in 1948, followed by another in 1953. In 1967, a female named Bába was born, essentially founding the breeding program by producing several offspring until her death in 1985.",
