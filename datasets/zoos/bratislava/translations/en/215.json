  "attractions": "In the Africa Up Close pavilion, you’ll find two multi-species exhibits housing crepuscular and nocturnal animals. Special lighting, perceived by the animals as a shade of gray, reverses their activity cycle. One exhibit is home to a group of prosimian gray mouse lemurs from the lemur family. They spend much of their time foraging—nimbly running along branches and inspecting every leaf for a tasty morsel. They can easily hang by their strong hind legs even on thin twigs. Mouse lemurs enjoy insects, fruits, and flowers, but they particularly relish sweet juices. For such small creatures, they are remarkably long-lived, reaching up to 14 years in human care.",
