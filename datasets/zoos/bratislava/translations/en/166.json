Its habitat is the Tibetan highlands, where temperatures drop below -40°C in winter at around 4,000 m elevation. Herds consist primarily of females and young. Stallions are territorial, guarding the mares in their domain. Young males often form bachelor groups until they establish their own territories. A newborn kiang can follow its mother within an hour and stays close to her in the early days. Kiangs have three subspecies, with the eastern kiang being the largest.",
