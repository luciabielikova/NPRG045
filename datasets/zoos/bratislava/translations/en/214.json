While adept climbers who sleep in trees, they primarily search for food—especially figs and other fruits—on the ground. In some regions, people train them to collect fruits from tree canopies.",

  "breeding": "We took in a group of pig-tailed macaques in 2004 from an Austrian safari in Gänsendorf, where breeding programs were being discontinued, risking the breakup of this cohesive primate group and their dispersal to various breeders. With the completion of the Indonesian Jungle pavilion, where one island was planned for a macaque species, we adopted the entire group. Interestingly, despite this measure and their apparent adaptation, it took several years for them to start breeding. The first successful offspring was a female named Rousie in 2011, who still lives in the group.",
