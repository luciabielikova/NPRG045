  "reproduction": "Females lay 5–7 eggs in a soil pit; incubation lasts 59–69 days.",
  "attractions": "The East African agama is a highly active diurnal lizard. Dominant males often perch on elevated spots, overseeing their territory and the females within it. They ward off rivals with vigorous head-bobbing, escalating to swift attacks if needed. During courtship, the male approaches the female from behind, bobbing and sidestepping, attempting to grasp her neck. A willing female raises her head and tail high. Copulation lasts a brief 1–2 minutes.",
