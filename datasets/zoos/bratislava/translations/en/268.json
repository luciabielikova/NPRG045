  "attractions": "The spectacled owl is a fast and agile flier. When hunting, it spots prey, swiftly snatches it, and returns to its perch. At other times, it picks animals from leaves and branches. The male emits a peculiar sound, like a hammer tapping a dry branch, while the female’s call is a piercing scream. Both parents take turns incubating eggs and caring for the young (usually only one survives).",
