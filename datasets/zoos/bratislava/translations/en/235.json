  "name": "African Brush-tailed Porcupine",
  "description": "They are slender, with a long, scaly tail ending in a tuft of light, stiff hairs, and quills growing only on the rear part of the back. The rest of the body is covered with short, flat bristles. The stiff hairs at the tail tip are widened and hollow in the middle, producing a peculiar rustling sound when the porcupine shakes its tail in agitation.",

  "attractions": "Brush-tailed porcupines are close relatives of porcupines but resemble them only partially. They aren’t stocky but slender, with a long, scaly tail ending in a tuft of light, stiff hairs, and quills only on the rear back. The rest of the body has short, flat bristles. The stiff tail hairs, widened and hollow in the middle, rustle oddly when the porcupine shakes its tail in agitation. Unlike porcupines, they mostly inhabit forests, often retreating to trees from danger, and are skilled at climbing and leaping. Their diet also differs, favoring fruits over tougher roots or plant stems. The African brush-tailed porcupine, displayed in our Africa Up Close exhibit, can be seen as a prototype of all brush-tails. It lives in family groups of a parental pair and young. At night, they forage, while spending the day safe in rock crevices, small caves, or under tree roots.",
