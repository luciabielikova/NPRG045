  "attractions": "Only distantly related to geese—scientists place it in its own family within Anseriformes. A gregarious species, it nests in colonies and gathers in flocks outside breeding season, sometimes numbering over a thousand. Its nesting habits are remarkable among Anseriformes: males often share incubation and chick-rearing with two females instead of one, and parents bring food to the young in the tip of their beaks, a behavior unique among waterfowl. Three parents improve provisioning and protection, increasing chick survival rates. In the wild, they can live over 30 years.",
