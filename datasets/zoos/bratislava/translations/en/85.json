  "proportions": "Body length 22.5–30.5 cm; tail length 4.5–5.4 cm; wingspan 40–58 cm; weight 59–170 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 2–9 eggs; incubation lasts 16–21 days.",
  "attractions": "When disturbed, it adopts a motionless stance with its neck stretched and beak pointed upward, resembling a dry stump. Despite its discreet nature, it compensates with its voice—during mating season, the males’ rhythmic, deep calls echo far across the nocturnal waterscape. Once the most abundant heron in the Czech Republic, it is now critically endangered here, with only a few dozen pairs found between spring and autumn. Globally, however, it remains common. European little bitterns migrate to equatorial Africa for winter.",
  "projects_note": "",
  "breeding": "The first pair arrived in 2007. The male died five years later, but the female still lives at the zoo. The first chick was raised in 2009, followed by further successful nestings, most recently two chicks in May 2013.",
