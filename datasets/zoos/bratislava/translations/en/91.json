  "reproduction": "Females lay 3–6 eggs; incubation lasts 31–33 days.",
  "attractions": "It lives discreetly, often escaping notice despite its size. For nesting, it seeks extensive forests, building a wide twig nest high in tree crowns.

  "breeding": "A single black stork was kept at the zoo in 1934. In the 1950s, many passed through Prague Zoo as part of transits to Western Europe, some staying for years. From the mid-1970s to 1992, there was a break in breeding, but since then, we have kept black storks continuously. The first chicks were raised in 1995.",
