Cheetah females live solitarily, while males often form lifelong alliances with their brothers, making them one of the few partially social cat species. Cheetah cubs are born with a light, erect mane on their neck and back. They are grayish but already bear the adults’ typical spotted pattern.",

  "breeding": "Prague Zoo has kept cheetahs since 1933, but we only saw cubs in 1972. The female Brita proved an exemplary mother from the start, giving birth to 27 cubs over the years, most of which she successfully raised. Today, cheetahs inhabit an exhibit in the lower zoo area, next to the Big Cats Pavilion. They lazily rest in the grass or tirelessly patrol their territory along worn paths, marking it with urine as they would in the African wild. They also enjoy keenly observing their surroundings, with a perfect vantage point.",
