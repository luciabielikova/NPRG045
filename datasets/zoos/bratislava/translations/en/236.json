  "reproduction": "Gestation 5 months; 1–2 young",
  "attractions": "Slow lorises are prosimians, sharing traits like crepuscular activity. Their large eyes enable excellent night vision, though only in black and white. The Sunda slow loris spends the day sleeping in branch forks, moving slowly along branches at night to forage. It doesn’t leap, so it has no need for a tail. It eats fruits, flowers, resin, shoots, and young leaves, with insects and other invertebrates also part of its diet, caught with its front paws. It’s solitary but lacks a defined territory, and meetings with other lorises rarely lead to conflict—animals sniff each other and sometimes groom mutually. They communicate with scents and vocalizations. Females nurse their single young for up to 6 months.",
  "projects_note": "The Sunda slow loris is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to extensive capture for the pet trade and deforestation of the tropical forests it inhabits.",
  "breeding": "We kept slow lorises from 1952–1969, then again in the 1980s. Since 1997, we’ve kept the subspecies N. c. coucang. The first young was successfully raised in 2004.",
