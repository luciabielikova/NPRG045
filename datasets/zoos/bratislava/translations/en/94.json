  "attractions": "Lapwings are usually shy, but during nesting season, they become very conspicuous. They nest in any open grassy area. The pair fiercely defends their nesting territory, attempting to drive away or distract predators from the nest. During attacks, they use a prominent spur on the wing bend. Fledged young often stay with their parents for the next year. They communicate with a wide range of sounds.",
