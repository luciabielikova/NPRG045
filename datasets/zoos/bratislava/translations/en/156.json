  "name": "White-headed Duck",
  "description": "It is characterized by its typically tiered tail feathers, which it raises perpendicular to its body while swimming on the surface. You can easily recognize it by its beak with a prominent hump at the base.",
  "spread_note": "Discontinuous range from Spain eastward to China",
  "food": "Invertebrates",
  "food_note": "Parts of aquatic plants, aquatic invertebrates",
  "image_alt": "White-headed Duck, photo: Jiří Trojánek, Prague Zoo",
  "proportions": "Length 43–48 cm; wingspan 62–70 cm; weight 0.5–0.8 kg",
  "reproduction": "Lays 5–8 eggs; incubation 22–24 days",
  "attractions": "It flies clumsily and heavily, making it an easy target for hunters. Outside the breeding season, it gathers in large flocks. During breeding, they are temporarily monogamous, with the male attracting the female with peculiar rattling sounds. The nest is built in dense shore vegetation, often with a 'canopy' of bent leaves.",
  "projects_note": "The white-headed duck population currently appears stable, yet it is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. After a sharp decline in numbers over previous decades, when it nearly vanished from the Mediterranean, around 8,000–13,000 individuals exist today. This is exemplified by Spain’s population: in the 1950s, about 400 bred there, dropping to just 22 twenty years later. By 2006, thanks to consistent habitat protection, over 2,500 were breeding in Spain. The greatest threats are habitat loss and intensive hunting at wintering grounds, as well as hybridization with the American ruddy duck, introduced to England and later spreading to southern Europe.",
  "breeding": "The first pair arrived in 1998. A brief interruption occurred from 2002–2004 due to the August flood, with breeding resuming after two new pairs arrived. The first chick was raised in 2013.",
