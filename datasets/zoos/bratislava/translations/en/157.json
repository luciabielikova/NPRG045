  "proportions": "Length 35–38 cm; weight 190–360 g",
  "reproduction": "Lays 6–12 eggs; incubation 26–28 days",
  "attractions": "Due to its secretive lifestyle in impenetrable forests, little is known about its life; the incubation period is derived from captive breeding. It lives in pairs or small groups. It nests in tree hollows or old nests of other bird species, which is quite atypical for dabbling ducks. Experts are still unclear about its exact taxonomic relations—it may be closer to shelducks than typical ducks. Observations from captivity suggest this, as both parents care for the young, a trait characteristic of shelducks, though only the female incubates.",
