  "name": "Alpaca",
  "description": "The alpaca has a compact appearance—short body, rounded head, small ears, and a relatively short, straight tail. The huacaya breed has shorter, wavy fleece, while the suri type has long, straighter fleece. The coat, covering the body, legs, and face, can be white, fawn, brown, nearly black, or bicolored.",

  "proportions": "Body length 1.2–2.5 m; tail length 60–80 cm; shoulder height 94–104 cm; weight 55–65 kg",
  "reproduction": "Females are pregnant for 342–345 days and give birth to one cria.",
  "attractions": "Males have lower canines up to 3 cm long, used in fights with each other. Long thought to descend from the wild guanaco, scientists now believe it evolved from the smaller vicuña. Its thick coat suggests it thrives in the harsh climates of the South American Andes, its native home. Unlike the domesticated llama, the alpaca is not used as a pack animal but for its high-quality wool and lean meat.",
