  "proportions": "Body length 17–29 cm; tail length 7–8 cm; wing length 15.5–17.5 cm; weight 190–310 g",
  "reproduction": "2–3 eggs; incubation 14 days",
  "attractions": "Despite its somewhat exotic appearance, the hill myna cannot deny its kinship with starlings. Like our common starling, it easily adapts to human presence. Outside the breeding season, it stays in small groups, mainly in tree canopies, foraging for fruits, especially favoring figs. It also feeds on buds, nectar, insects, and occasionally catches a lizard. The male boasts a fairly wide vocal range, though not particularly melodic. Hill mynas kept in households readily learn to mimic various tunes and even whole sentences.",
