  "attractions": "Swamphens are related to moorhens and rails, within the order Gruiformes. Their relatively short necks and hunched posture suggest they often push through dense vegetation. The western swamphen nests in overgrown water bodies but forages in reeds or tall grass too. Sometimes it forms temporary groups of unrelated birds (mostly males), though family flocks with a few adults and their offspring are more common. Only one or two dominant females nest, laying eggs in a shared nest, and all group members care for the young.",
