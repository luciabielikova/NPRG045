  "attractions": "It is a social species. Groups of up to 30 lemurs roam the forest during the day, foraging for food. When moving through tall undergrowth, they maintain contact with their upright black-and-white tails. The tail also serves another purpose—lemurs scent it with gland secretions from their chest, leaving a distinctive odor trail. Upon finding a suitable spot during their wanderings, they climb trees to search for food. They enjoy sunbathing while sitting with arms spread wide. Females often give birth to twins, nursing them while seated. During group movements, they carry the young on their backs.",

  "breeding": "Visitors to Prague Zoo have observed ring-tailed lemurs, with a few short breaks, since 1960, when the first pair arrived from Paris Zoo. In recent years, we have kept a male group that shares an island with males of brown and white-fronted lemurs. The first ring-tailed lemur young were successfully raised in 1993. One of them, a male named Chocholka, lives in this group.",
