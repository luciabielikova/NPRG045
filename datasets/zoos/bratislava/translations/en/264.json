  "attractions": "As their name suggests, prairie dogs inhabit North America’s grassy prairies, where they build vast underground towns often shared with other species, from snakes to black-footed ferrets. They’re highly social; though each family digs its own burrow system, these are interconnected. When a group grows too large for its home, the young stay in the original burrows, while experienced adults colonize nearby areas. Prairie dogs are diurnal. In their colonies, several always stand guard while others go about their tasks, warning of danger with a loud, barking call.",
