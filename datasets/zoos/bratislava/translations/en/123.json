  "attractions": "Gundis are highly social, giving birth to large, furred young. When threatened with no escape, they press themselves flat to the ground, freeze, and hold their breath to avoid detection. They are fast and agile, vanishing into the nearest shelter at the slightest hint of danger and effortlessly scaling near-vertical rock faces. Two toes on their hind feet have stiff bristles, serving as a comb to groom their fur. Active in the morning and evening, they forage, traveling up to a kilometer. They don’t need to drink, obtaining water from food. These small rodents are especially known to parasitologists: in the 19th century, the blood parasite causing toxoplasmosis (often linked to cats in the Czech Republic) was first identified in a gundi, later named Toxoplasma gundi after it.",
