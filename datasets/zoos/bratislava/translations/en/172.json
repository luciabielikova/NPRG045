  "attractions": "It is the largest kangaroo species and, in Australia, mirrors the lifestyle of large ungulates on African savannas. They form variably sized, loosely organized groups. During the day, they rest in the shade, grazing in the morning and evening. Like all marsupials, they have a short gestation. Newborns are tiny and underdeveloped—essentially born during incomplete embryonic development—yet must immediately perform an incredible feat: climbing unaided up the mother’s belly into the pouch to latch onto a teat. Thus, a newborn kangaroo has stronger forelimbs than hindlimbs. The mother offers no help beyond cleaning the pouch beforehand and moistening her belly fur with her tongue. Inside the securely closed pouch, protected by strong sphincter muscles, the joey is warm and safe, suckling from a swollen teat. Occasionally, a joey falls out; if too small, it is doomed in the wild, as the female won’t return it. Only when strong enough to move independently does it begin leaving the pouch, returning at the slightest sign of danger.",

  "breeding": "The red kangaroo was among the first animals at the zoo. One stayed briefly in 1935. Records note another in 1953, followed by many in the 1960s, likely in transit to other keepers. The first successful breeding was documented in 1966.",
