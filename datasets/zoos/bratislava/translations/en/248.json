  "reproduction": "Females lay 8–15 eggs, incubated for 23–27 days.",
  "attractions": "It inhabits savannas, where several guineafowl always form groups of varying sizes. One member keeps watch while others dig for food with strong claws and beaks. During breeding, they form pairs that jointly feed and lead the young, though only the female incubates. They spend most of the day on the ground foraging, and like all guineafowl, prefer running over flying, even when threatened. They only fly into trees or large bushes at night.",

  "breeding": "The first two guineafowl arrived at the zoo in 1955, but records of their fate are missing. In modern times, we’ve kept them since 2005.",
