  "reproduction": "Females are pregnant for 30 days and bear 1 young",
  "attractions": "It is a subspecies of the red-necked wallaby. It is quite hardy, tolerating low temperatures thanks to dense fur covering its body and tail. It is often kept in parks and enclosures. It frequently produces albino individuals with white fur and blue eyes. As adults, Bennett’s wallabies tend to live solitarily, occasionally forming loose groups of up to 30 animals. Like other marsupials, they exhibit unique traits. Females have two vaginas and two uteri, functioning alternately during successive breeding periods. During pregnancy, a third vagina (without a uterus) forms as a birth canal. Thus, a female can raise multiple offspring of different ages simultaneously: a newly fertilized egg waits in a dormant state in the oviduct (diapause), an older embryo develops in the uterus, a joey is attached in the pouch, and she may still nurse an older offspring too large for the pouch.",

  "breeding": "The first red-necked wallabies (subspecies unspecified) arrived from England. In 1946, a pair from London Zoo produced the first offspring. More arrived from Whipsnade in the 1950s, some of their descendants later sent to Beijing in 1956. We stopped keeping them in the 1970s, but new individuals of the subspecies M. r. rufogriseus arrived in 2003.",
